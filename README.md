# CLIP-LoRA-Classifier

## Overview

CLIP-LoRA-Classifier is designed to enhance image classification tasks by fine-tuning the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables efficient adaptation of large-scale vision-language models to specific classification tasks with limited data, leveraging LoRA's parameter-efficient fine-tuning capabilities.

## Key Components

- `main.py`: Orchestrates the training and evaluation processes for the classification task. It loads the CLIP model, applies LoRA adaptations, prepares datasets, and manages the training loop.
  
- `lora.py`: Implements the LoRA adaptation mechanism, enabling the integration of trainable low-rank matrices into the CLIP model's layers to facilitate efficient fine-tuning for classification purposes.

- `custom_dataset.py`: Defines a custom dataset class tailored for image classification tasks. It handles data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation to ensure the dataset is compatible with the CLIP model's requirements.

## Dataset Preparation

To prepare your dataset for classification:

1. **Organize Data**: Structure your dataset into appropriate directories, typically with separate folders for each class containing corresponding images.

2. **Preprocessing**: Utilize the transformations defined in `custom_dataset.py` to preprocess images, ensuring they align with the input requirements of the CLIP model.

3. **Loading Data**: Use the dataset class from `custom_dataset.py` to load your data, which can then be fed into the training pipeline managed by `main.py`.

## Training Procedure

1. **Initialize Model**: `main.py` loads the pre-trained CLIP model and applies LoRA adaptations as defined in `lora.py`.

2. **Data Loading**: The custom dataset is loaded and preprocessed using the methods from `custom_dataset.py`.

3. **Fine-Tuning**: The model undergoes fine-tuning on the classification dataset, with LoRA enabling efficient adaptation by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into the model's layers.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to assess its classification accuracy.

## LoRA Integration

The integration of LoRA into the CLIP model is managed by `lora.py`, which provides functions to:

- **Apply LoRA**: Introduce low-rank adaptations into specific layers of the CLIP model, facilitating efficient fine-tuning for classification tasks.

- **Manage Parameters**: Control which parameters are trainable during fine-tuning, focusing on the LoRA-adapted components to optimize computational efficiency.

- **Save and Load States**: Handle the saving and loading of LoRA-adapted model states, ensuring reproducibility and ease of deployment.

## Usage

To fine-tune the CLIP model for your classification task:

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Organize and preprocess your dataset as outlined above.

2. **Configure Training**: Adjust training parameters and configurations in `main.py` to suit your specific classification task.

3. **Run Training**: Execute `main.py` to initiate the fine-tuning process. Monitor training progress and evaluate the model's performance using the provided evaluation metrics.
